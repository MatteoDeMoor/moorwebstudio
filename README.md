## Project Overview

This repository contains the static assets that power the Moor Web Studio website. It is built as a lightweight single-page experience to highlight featured work and services with responsive layouts and vibrant visuals.

### Key Highlights
- Hero banner with animated headline and call-to-action.
- Services section describing core offerings.
- Portfolio showcase with imagery sourced from the `images/` directory.
- Contact prompt that directs visitors to get in touch.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML5** for semantic structure (`index.html`).
- **CSS3** for layout, typography, and animations (`styles.css`).
- **JavaScript** for interactive behaviors and dynamic elements (`app.js`).
- **XML Sitemap** for search indexing support (`sitemap.xml`).

## Sitemap

Submit [`sitemap.xml`](./sitemap.xml) to Google Search Console (or any other search engine webmaster tool) after deployment to help crawlers find the site quickly. The sitemap currently lists the root URL (`https://moorwebstudio.be/`) and the canonical HTML entry point (`https://moorwebstudio.be/index.html`). Update the `<lastmod>` timestamps whenever significant content updates are published.
